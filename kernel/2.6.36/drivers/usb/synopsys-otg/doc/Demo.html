<H1>Running Demo Application on NC Platform (IPMate)</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><BR>Run the provided &quot;demo&quot;
script (located in the /root/bin/ directory of  root-ipmate.cramfs)
to start the demo and load appropriate driver modules.<BR><BR>During
the demo, there are two file list boxes. The left one represents the
host machine. The files on the /mnt/localfs are shown here. The right
one shows the files on an attached USB mass storage device. You can
open image files from either side, and also transfer files back and
forth. Once you've opened an image, you can print or close the
image.<BR><BR>Printing is enabled by attaching an HP photosmart 240
printer on the bus. Printing directly from a file on a USB device is
only supported if a hub is<BR>attached.<BR><BR>It may take some
amount of time for the demo to detect attachment and removal of USB
devices. Do not remove the USB device while transferring files,
printing, or<BR>picture loading.<BR><BR><BR>

Procedure</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0.2in">- Start with
mini-A connector and cable connected to the IPMate and a mini-B
connector connected to the camera.<BR><BR>- Power on the IPMate. Use
a serial console to control the demo.<BR><BR>- Log in as root.<BR><BR>-
Execute &quot;demo&quot; or &quot;demo mouse&quot;. The former uses
the touch screen on the IPMate. The latter allows using a mouse.<BR><BR>-
Wait for the GUI to appear on the LCD. The drivers load after the GUI
and they take about 5 seconds to load.<BR><BR>- If the camera was
turned on at the start of the demo, the application should detect the
device after the drivers load and display the top level directory
from the camera. Otherwise, turn on the camera now and the demo will
detect it and display the top level directory.<BR><BR>- Navigate to
the dcim/101msdcf directory (or something similar) by using the Open
button on the device side of the screen.<BR><BR>- Transfer some files
from the camera to the Local Files area.<BR><BR>- Choose one of the
pictures in Local Files and Open it.<BR><BR>- When the picture viewer
opens, disconnect the mini-A to mini-B cable and connect the mini-A
to male-B cable between the IPMate and the<BR>printer.<BR><BR>- Make
sure the printer is on. Press the Print button on the application to
print the picture. You can close the picture after printing.<BR><BR>-
Remove the mini-A cable from the IPMate. Attach the mini-B to male-A
connector between the IPMate and the Windows XP host. The IPMate
should appear as a mass storage device in Windows Explorer.<BR><BR>-
View pictures transferred from the camera on the Windows XP host.<BR><BR>-
Demo complete!</P>
