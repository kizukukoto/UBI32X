Description
-----------
The ISL29011 is an integrated ambient and infrared light to digital converter
with built in IR LED driver and I2C interface.  It features I2C user 
programmable lux range select for optimized counts/lux, IR LED source current,
and multi-function control and monitoring capabilities. The internal ADC 
provides 16-bit resolution while rejecting 50Hz and 60Hz flicker caused by
artificial light sources.

The driver allows to set the lux range, the bit resolution, the operational
mode (see below) and the power state of device and can read the current lux
value, of course.


Detection
---------

The ISL29011 does not have an ID register which could be used to identify
it, so the detection routine will just try to read from the configured I2C
addess and consider the device to be present as soon as it ACKs the
transfer.
