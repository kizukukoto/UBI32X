 Introduction
================================

This file will show you how to build the GPL linux system.

    1. Install Fedora Linux 12 (choose Software Development) on 32bit CPU.
    2. Login as a normal user (have the root password handy).
    3. Upgrade the version git from 1.65 to the latest one.
       Use this guide http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
            - Download the latest git source tarball
            - Extract and use the following commands to upgrade git:
                    $ make configure
                    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
                    $ make all
                    $ su
                    # make install
                    # exit
    4. Create and change into directory where you'll put the source code (~/Development works fine)
    5. Clone the custom firmware repository from GitHub.
            $ git clone https://github.com/kizukukoto/WD900X.git
    
================================
 Setup build environment
================================

    1. Login as a normal user.
    2. Navigate to your source code directory.
	    $ cd /WD900X
    3. Switch to root permission (superuser mode)
            $ su
    4. Install fakeroot
            # rpm -ivh ./include/fakeroot-1.12.2-22.fc12.i686.rpm
            # rpm -ivh ./include/fakeroot-libs-1.12.2-22.fc12.i686.rpm
    5. Use this command to setup toolchain
            # make
    6. Switch back to normal permission (normaluser mode)
	    # exit
    
================================
 Compiling source code
================================

    1. Login as a normal user.
    2. Navigate to your source code directory.
	    $ cd /WD900X
    3. Load the necessary environment variables.
            $ source ./setupenv
    4. Building the image
	    $ make
    
    After make finishes successfully, you will find the image file in ./build/release
